      <description>Introduction Recently, React Redux released hooks API. It&amp;rsquo;s v7.1.0-alpha.4 as of writing.
https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v7.1.0-alpha.4
On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing a new React Redux binding library with hooks and Proxy.
https://github.com/dai-shi/reactive-react-redux
It&amp;rsquo;s time to benchmark both of them to have better understanding in performance. The reactive-react-redux library utilizes Proxy to auto-detect state usage, hence it technically has overhead which would affect performance. We would like to learn how much it will be affected in a realistic example.</description>

      <description>Introduction React Redux is one of popular web tech stacks. As I found React hooks so promising, I have been developing a hooks-based library for React Redux called &amp;ldquo;reactive-react-redux.&amp;rdquo;
https://github.com/dai-shi/reactive-react-redux
Coding style using this library is mentally different from the official react-redux. Thanks to Proxy, developers don&amp;rsquo;t need to care about optimization, but just focus on composition of logic.
This library provides two basic hooks: useReduxState and useReduxDispatch. This article shows example code how to use them.</description>

      <description>This short article shows code examples how hooks are analogous to components in terms of composition. Without a word, let&amp;rsquo;s jump in the code.
React components Let&amp;rsquo;s use a minimalistic example. Here&amp;rsquo;s a component.
const Person = ({ person }) =&amp;gt; ( &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div className=&amp;#34;personFirstName&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;First Name:&amp;lt;span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;{person.firstName}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div className=&amp;#34;personLastName&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Last Name:&amp;lt;span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;{person.lastName}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; ); Well, this component is a little bit big, so let&amp;rsquo;s split it into functions and compose them.</description>

      <description>Background React 16.8 added a new API, Hooks. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t learned hooks yet, go to the official site and read the entire document before continuing this article.
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Thisâ€¦ reactjs.org This article is about how to create custom hooks for data fetching. As described in the roadmap, React is planning to release react-cache and Suspense for data fetching in the near future.</description>

      <description>Introduction According to React 16.x Roadmap, we are expecting Concurrent Mode soon.
 React 16.x (~Q2 2019): The One with Concurrent Mode Concurrent Mode lets React apps be more responsive by rendering component trees without blocking the main thread. It is opt-in and allows React to interrupt a long-running render (for example, rendering a new feed story) to handle a high-priority event (for example, text input or hover). Concurrent Mode also improves the user experience of Suspense by skipping unnecessary loading states on fast connections.</description>

      <description>Introduction While I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like coding React without hooks, react-cache still seems to be still far away. Surely, caching in data fetching important, nevertheless I would like to seek possibilities of implementations only with React Hooks. These might be obsoleted in the future, but I want something today, that is &amp;ldquo;useFetch&amp;rdquo;. This could be still useful without react-cache in case sophisticated caching is not necessary.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started developing &amp;ldquo;useFetch&amp;rdquo; as a tutorial to build a custom hook.</description>

      <description>Introduction React Hooks is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lately. What&amp;rsquo;s wonderful is creating custom hooks. If you encapsulate logic nicely in a hook, it can be shared among components and used intuitively. You can find my custom hooks in my GitHub repos, some of which are very experimental.
This time, my experiment is to combine React Hooks and Web Workers. I know it&amp;rsquo;s not too difficult, but let me explain a bit in this short article.</description>

      <title>A thought on React Context default value</title>

      <guid>https://blog.axlight.com/posts/a-thought-on-react-context-default-value/</guid>
      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s been about a year since React Context API is out. This is powerful and it&amp;rsquo;s even more powerful with upcoming React Hooks API, namely useContext. Please check out official documents to learn them in detail.
https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
Now, this very short article is just about the default value of a context. When you create a context, you pass a default value in the first argument.
 The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree.</description>

      <title>Developing React custom hooks for abortable async functions with AbortController</title>
      <link>https://blog.axlight.com/posts/developing-react-custom-hooks-for-abortable-async-functions-with-abortcontroller/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.axlight.com/posts/developing-react-custom-hooks-for-abortable-async-functions-with-abortcontroller/</guid>
      <description>In my previous article, I introduced how the custom hook useAsyncTask handles async functions with AbortController and demonstrated a typeahead search example. In this article, I explain about the implementation of useAsyncTask.
Recap JavaScript promise is not abortable. The fetch API is based on promise, and hence you can&amp;rsquo;t cancel it in pure JavaScript. To cancel fetch, the DOM spec introduced AbortController. The AbortController is a general interface and not specific to fetch.</description>

      <title>Developing React custom hooks for Redux without react-redux</title>

      <description>Background Ever since I learned Redux, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking an alternative integration of react and redux to the official react-redux library. The intuition behind it is that Redux is super simple which I like a lot, whereas react-redux is complex because of performance tuning. If you are developing a business product, the official react-redux is to go without a doubt, but if you are playing with creating a toy app or you are just starting learning Redux, you might want something more straightforward.</description>

      <description>There is a follow-up article which describes the implementation details of the library. Please visit here.
 TL;DR Just visit the example in codesandbox and try it.
Background You can&amp;rsquo;t cancel promises in JavaScript and that&amp;rsquo;s one of the reason why libraries such as redux-saga and redux-observables are popular because they allow cancellation. While they are good solutions as well as Redux is, there might be a case when you want just a cancellation mechanism for a promise, not the entire framework.</description>

      <title>React Hooks Tutorial on Developing a Custom Hook for Data Fetching</title>

      <guid>https://blog.axlight.com/posts/react-hooks-tutorial-on-developing-a-custom-hook-for-data-fetching/</guid>
      <description>Introduction React Hooks are a new feature coming in React 16.7. It allows us to write stateful function components that were impossible before without class components. The official docs are must-read, so check them out if you haven&amp;rsquo;t.
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
Besides stateful function components, this new feature allow us to build a custom hook to share logic between components. This has been possible with High-order Components (HoCs), and although there&amp;rsquo;s technically no difference what hooks can achieve, hooks simplify it a lot and reduce so called &amp;ldquo;wrapper hell&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>There is a follow-up article which describes the implementation details of this library. Please visit here.
 Redux is one of the popular libraries for React. Although Redux itself is not tied to React, it&amp;rsquo;s often used with the official bindings react-redux that allows to connect Redux state to any React components.
In this article, we propose another bindings library to combine React and Redux. This library tries to be simple and easy for beginners.</description>

      <description>In this article, I will first explain minimal code to implement global state with useReducer and useContext which are called &amp;ldquo;hooks&amp;rdquo; that will be available in React 16.7. I will then compare it with react-hooks-global-state which is a tiny library that I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing for global state management primarily for small applications.
Note: Global state is convenient for sharing values among components far apart in the component tree, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be abused because it would limit the reusability.</description>

      <description>The library I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing a library to make use of React Hooks API. The library is for global state mangement with the aim to use it instead of Redux, especially for smaller applications. See the repository for more information and the source code.
https://github.com/dai-shi/react-hooks-global-state
Please also check out my previous posts [1] [2].
Support for Redux middleware Originally, the library was extending useState for global state. Later, reducer is supported.</description>

      <title>An alternative to React Redux by React Hooks API (For both JavaScript and TypeScript)</title>

      <description>Motivation Everyone is excited about the new React Hooks API. So am I. Having been thinking how to manage global state, the Hooks API seems promising. By the way, I like Redux a lot, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like react-redux a.k.a connect very much. It is too complicated for beginners to use it properly. For example, reselect / memoization is a hard concept to explain. My recommendation is to structure a global state so that mapStateToProps only needs to select a part of the state without any logic.</description>

      <description>React Hooks API is a new proposal for React v16.7. It enables writing all components as functions with full functionality. You can develop &amp;ldquo;custom hooks&amp;rdquo; to add a new functionality. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not released yet, I would like to introduce a new library to support global state. Note that it&amp;rsquo;s still an experiment.
The library It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;react-hooks-global-state&amp;rdquo; and is available in npm. Please also checkout the GitHub repository.</description>
